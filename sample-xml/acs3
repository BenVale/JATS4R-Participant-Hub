         <p><?A3B2 tlsb=0.02w?>My current research interests
are focused on the studies at the molecular level of diverse biomolecular
interactions by using NMR as a tool to unravel the molecular recognition
mechanisms that govern physiologically relevant biological processes.
I started my scientific career working on the characterization of
the structure, dynamics and electrostatics of the cytotoxic RNase
α-sarcin and contributed to establish the basis for its structure–function
relationships. Afterward, during my postdoctoral period, I moved to
work on the characterization of protein-RNA interactions on KSRP,
a protein involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene
expression that affects mRNA degradation. We developed the SIA method
for the analysis of the sequence specificity of single-stranded RNA-binding
domains. Recently, I have been involved in the characterization of
protein–protein interactions of several microtubule-related
proteins (TBCC, DYNLL1, DYNLT1), as well as protein–carbohydrate
and protein–membrane interactions of the cytotoxic RNase ECP
to get insights into the molecular basis of the cytotoxic mechanism
of action. (Read Garcia’s article, DOI: <xref rid="cb300386v">10.1021/cb300386v</xref>)</p>

         <p>My current research focuses on altering
the substrate specificity of enzymes for use in drug discovery and
chemical biology. The primary target of my research is the multimodular
polyketide synthases (PKSs) that are responsible for the assembly
of a large variety of therapeutically relevant polyketide natural
products. Here, we used structure-guided mutagenesis to produce variants
of the malonyl-Coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase (MatB) that are capable
of synthesizing a broad range of acyl-CoA extender units for polyketide
biosynthesis. These promiscuous synthetases were used to probe the
specificity of several polyketide biosynthetic systems and revealed
unprecedented promiscuity toward several non-natural extender units.
Future work will harness this promiscuity by developing new synthetic
biology strategies for the regioselective modification of polyketides.
Additionally, the incorporation of bioorthogonal handles for chemoselective
ligation chemistry should enable the directed evolution of polyketide
biosynthesis. (Read Koryakina’s article, DOI: <xref rid="cb3003489">10.1021/cb3003489</xref>)</p>

         <p>My research goal has been to identify and characterize
the function of a widely conserved but poorly understood protein,
RidA (formerly YjgF). I found that this protein is responsible for
neutralizing reactive intermediates that are generated as a normal
part of amino acid metabolism. Our paper in <italic toggle="yes">ACS Chemical Biology</italic> details a role for one of these reactive intermediates in generating
a thiamine precursor, an unrelated molecule in an unrelated pathway,
by a novel mechanism. This work is one example of the amazing connections
that continue be found within metabolic networks across all of biology.
Further investigation of metabolic connections is critical, as elucidating
the interactions between metabolites and pathways may yield important
insight into human metabolic diseases and potential treatments. (Read

         <p>Protein domains are structurally
conserved despite hypervariability in amino acid sequences. My graduate
research focuses on determining the key structural determinant(s)
of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains. In this work, we selected
the fourth and fifth EGF domains of thrombomodulin, which fold into
the canonical and noncanonical structure, respectively, as models.
By comparing the folding tendencies of synthetic peptides based on
these domains, we identified a single highly conserved hydrophobic
residue in intercysteine loop 3 that acts as the key structural determinant
of the canonical fold, without which the EGF domain switches to an
alternate fold. The results demonstrate how a single residue can act
as a cog in determining protein fold and hence its function. Such
fundamental studies provide valuable insights into the evolution of
protein folding and structure. (Read Ng’s article, DOI: <xref rid="cb300445a">10.1021/cb300445a</xref>)</p>

a cell upon infection with a pathogen and how those processes are
regulated or misregulated in human disease. In the current study,
we have focused on characterizing the immediate effects of Dengue
virus infection on the host kinome using ATP- and ADP-acyl phosphates

also applied mass spectrometry-based profiling to examine hepatitis
B virus- and hepatitis C virus-induced changes in the host lipidome,
and all of these studies have uncovered new host–pathogen interactions.
As a postdoctoral fellow, I am focusing on innate immune responses
to understand how pathogen detection is regulated by host factors
and how these responses affect cell and host survival. (Read Rodger’s

         <title>Best of Chemical Biology 2012</title>
         <p><?A3B2 tlsb=0.05pt?>2012 was another wonderful
year for chemical biology, and we’ve used our Spotlight and
In This Issue sections to highlight new developments every month.
Now, looking back, the Editors have compiled a list of articles representing
some of the most exciting and relevant research from 2012. Please
note that it is simply not possible to recognize all of the amazing
work being published, and this list is not meant to be comprehensive.
However, we hope that this feature will at least provide a sense of
the richness and quality of research being published in chemical biology
as we move forward into a new decade. Happy New Year!</p>

         <p>All 8 of the molecules studied were found to form colloids in biochemical
buffer and in cell culture medium. Moreover, in cell-based assays
the activity of the colloidal form of 3 of the drugs was found to
be dramatically reduced compared to the monomeric <?A3B2 tlsb=.02w?>form. In addition,

conditions such as cancer, inflammation, and metabolic disorders.
The protein BRDT, a BET family member that recognizes acetyl-lysine
moieties on histones, is expressed in testis and is essential for
sperm production. The tissue-selective expression, coupled with the
association of mutations in the <italic toggle="yes">BRDT</italic> gene with infertility
in both animals and humans, points to BRDT as a potential target for
the design of male contraceptives. <?A3B2 tlsb=-.03w?>To this end, <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22901802">Matzuk <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic></ext-link> (<italic toggle="yes">Cell</italic> 2012, <italic toggle="yes">150</italic>, 673–684) report <?A3B2 show [?tjl=1000mm?]&#6;[?tjl]?>that the small molecule JQ1, a known inhibitor
of another BET family protein called BRD4, is a potent inhibitor of
sperm production.</p>
         <p><?A3B2 tlsb=-0.15pt?>Various biochemical and structural characterization
methods, including a homogeneous luminescence proximity assay, isothermal
titration calorimetry, and X-ray crystallography, demonstrated that
JQ1 is a potent and competitive inhibitor of BRDT. Pharmacokinetic
studies in male mice showed that JQ1 can effectively permeate the
blood–testis barrier. In addition, <?A3B2 show [?tjl=1000mm?]&#6;[?tjl]?>it was shown that JQ1 treatment
significantly reduces testis volume, sperm number and motility, and
production of new sperm, and genome-wide expression analysis demonstrated
a reduction in expression of a number of spermatogenic genes. Notably,
mice treated with JQ1 were phenotypically similar to mice deficient
in BRDT, supporting the notion that JQ1 acts through inhibition of
BRDT. The contraceptive effect of JQ1 was shown to be dose-dependent
and reversible within a few months, and the compound did not appear
to affect testosterone levels, mating behaviors, or developmental
processes in offspring. These compelling results designate JQ1 as
a promising lead compound for development of an oral contraceptive
drug for men.</p>

to oxidase a small molecule substrate called luciferin to generate

the structure of the small subunit of this heteromeric enzyme to increase
its stability and simultaneously tweaked the structure of its substrate
to create a molecule called furimazine. This novel enzyme–substrate
pair generates much brighter luminescence than the traditional pair
and is highly stable in culture medium and cells, suggesting it as
an improved bioluminescence system for biological discovery and analysis.</p>

one structure, but <?A3B2 show [?tjl=1000mm?]&#6;[?tjl]?>when it binds a different ligand, TGFα, it

         <title>Jellyfish by Design</title>
         <p>Tissue engineering is an exciting field with various diagnostic and
therapeutic applications. The relatively simplistic, umbrella-like
motion used by adult jellyfish, also called medusae, to move through
the water presents an attractive opportunity for designing a synthetic
muscular pump. Jellyfish, made up of a bell-shaped, transparent body
surrounded by a symmetric display of tentacles, require just a few
specific cell types, including motor neurons and striated muscle cells,
and efficient interactions with fluid to support their movement. <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22820316">Nawroth <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic></ext-link> (<italic toggle="yes">Nat. Biotechnol.</italic> 2012, <italic toggle="yes">30</italic>, 792–797) now combine computational design methods,
rat tissue, and versatile biomaterials to reverse engineer a “synthetic
jellyfish”, referred to as a medusoid, capable of moving like
a real jellyfish.</p>
         <p><?A3B2 tlsb=-0.05pt?>To simulate the rhythmic movement of the jellyfish
body, the <?A3B2 tlsb=-.03w?>authors use a sheet of cultured rat cardiac muscle cells
synchronized by an electrical field. To mimic the jellyfish contraction
and expansion strokes, they construct a bilayer composed of the muscle
cells, which <?A3B2 tlsb=.02w?>provide the force to contract the bell, and jellyfish-shaped
<?A3B2 tlsb=-.03w?>polydimethylsiloxane elastomer, which facilitates restoration of the
original shape. Finally, the medusoid was designed to contain wedge-shaped
lobes separated by gaps, a geometry that optimizes the efficiency
of fluid transport in the construct. Remarkably, medusoids with these
parameters achieved similar propulsion and contraction <?A3B2 tlsb?>movements,
velocities, and fluid currents as real jellyfish. The <?A3B2 tlsb=-.03w?>medusoids presented
here highlight the incredible potential of tissue <?A3B2 tlsb?>engineering for
developing designed biomaterials with various functionalities, including
those simulating entire organisms.</p>

light upon oxidation by the enzyme luciferase. The conjugate is stable
outside cells, but upon disulfide cleavage in the reducing environment

visualization of fatty acid uptake in two cell types, adipocytes and
fibroblasts, and also in several organs in mice genetically engineered
to express luciferase.</p>

called urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, or uPAR, on
their surface than do healthy cells. uPAR binds to an enzyme called
urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). The authors created a
bifunctional small molecule, called ARM-U, that binds to and inhibits
the activity of uPA and contains an antibody-recruiting antigen. When
an ARM-U–uPA complex binds uPAR-containing cancer cells, the
antigen acts as bait, luring disease-fighting antibodies to the cancer

         <title>Coding, Non-Coding, ENCODEing</title>
         <p><?A3B2 tlsb=-0.0pt?>Five years ago, a large consortium
announced the initial results of a bold project dubbed ENCODE, or
Encyclopedia of DNA Elements. At the time, this impressive collection
of data peered into 1% of the human genome to identify coding and
noncoding RNAs, functional DNA elements and methylation states, transcription
factor binding sites, and histone marks. This giant data set became
publicly available, and the nearly boundless opportunity for cross-comparison
and correlation spawned hundreds of research projects. The years that
followed the pilot study saw rapidly decreasing sequencing costs and
many new discoveries that proved that the human genome was still ripe
with secrets beyond the nucleotide code. Recently, the ENCODE team
announced the completion of the project with this rich data <?A3B2 tlsb=.03w?>set of
the entire human genome now available on the web <?A3B2 show [?tjl=1000mm?]&#6;[?tjl]?>and published as
a collection in a <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22955616">special issue</ext-link> (<italic toggle="yes">Nature</italic> 2012, <italic toggle="yes">489</italic>, 57–74).</p>
         <p><?A3B2 tlsb=-0.09pt?>Though the notion that the human genome is full of “junk
DNA” was debunked years earlier, the complete look offers finer
classification of the vast regions that do not encode proteins. Drawing
from parallel data sets on 147 normal and tumor cell types, the study
estimates that 80% of the genome can be assigned a biochemical function
in at least one cell type. A biochemical function was defined as an
RNA or chromatin-associated event in that portion of the genome. In
addition, much of the remaining DNA lies close to a regulatory event
with 99% of the genome being within 1,700 nucleotides of a biochemical
event characterized and measured by ENCODE. Interestingly, most of
the SNPs, or single nucleotide polymorphisms, that were previously
associated with <?A3B2 show [?tjl=1000mm?]&#6;[?tjl]?>a disease lie in or near ENCODE-defined functional
noncod<?A3B2 show --[?tjl=1000mm?]&#6;[?tjl]?>ing <?A3B2 tlsb=.01w?>elements and not in protein coding sequence. The cross-comparison
between chromatin states, transcription factor binding and RNA production
shows a strong correlation in most cases. This new encyclopedia stands
as a gold standard data resource that will both assist basic scientists
to better assign how the cell’s rules are written and medical
scientists to better understand what goes wrong in a cancer cell.
As generating <?A3B2 show [?tjl=1000mm?]&#6;[?tjl]?>these type of data becomes even less costly, new cell
types <?A3B2 show [?tjl=1000mm?]&#6;[?tjl]?>or cancer lines will be mined for their secrets and, just as
with the first complete human genome sequence, the ENCODE <?A3B2 show [?tjl=1000mm?]&#6;[?tjl]?>data will
be the critical resource against which all others are compared.</p>

         <title>Enter the Age of “Virtual Cell Biology”</title>
         <p><?A3B2 tlsb=.025w?>Computer models are powerful tools for understanding and predicting
biological phenotypes. An elusive goal has been <?A3B2 show [?tjl=1000mm?]&#6;[?tjl]?>to understand individual
interactions on a “whole-cell” scale that lead to complex
phenotypes. With the coming of age of genomics and high-throughput
techniques, however, characterization has begun to reach a level of
accuracy where comprehensive phenotypic prediction is within reach.
In a recent article, <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22817898">Karr <italic toggle="yes">et
al.</italic></ext-link> (<italic toggle="yes">Cell</italic>, 2012, <italic toggle="yes">150</italic>, 389–401) provide a revolutionary study that thrusts us into
a new era of “virtual cell biology”.</p>
         <p>The authors
selected <italic toggle="yes">Mycoplasma genitalium</italic>, a human urogenital
parasite with a small genome size (525 genes), for “whole-cell”
computational modeling. The functionality of cells was subdivided
into 28 independent modules (<italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic>, metabolism, protein
degradation, <italic toggle="yes">etc.</italic>) with each module modeled by an
appropriate mathematical representation. These independent modules
were subsequently integrated to interact and exchange variables in
other modules at 1 s intervals. This integrated simulation was subsequently
repeated several thousand times until termination when cell division
is simulated to cease upon the septum diameter variable reaching zero.
This “whole-cell” computational model accurately predicted
known experimental data across multiple biological functions. Interestingly,
the model also provided new insight into previously unobserved cellular
behavior, such as predicting factors that regulate cell-cycle duration.
On the basis of these predictive models it is easy to envision integrative “whole-cell”
models revolutionizing experimental design and stimulating biological
discovery.</p>

killers like HIV, <italic toggle="yes">Plasmodium</italic> is not transmitted from

the gametocytes from one infected human’s blood to begin a

strains of a symbiotic bacterium that normally lives in the mosquito
midgut, a key incubator for the maturing malarial parasite. These
strains of <italic toggle="yes">Pantoea agglomerans</italic> all harbored the <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> hemolysin system, which facilitates secretion of
proteins through a membrane pore. Each individual strain also expressed
one or more known antimalarial proteins tagged for secretion. Taking
advantage of the known life stage in the midgut, the various therapeutic
proteins targeted the <italic toggle="yes">Plasmodium</italic> ookinete or the
mosquito midgut players involved during invasion by the ookinete.
After the researchers proved that the <italic toggle="yes">Pantoea</italic> strains
displayed robust expression and secretion of the proteins, each were
fed to mosquitos to colonize the midgut before administering a blood
meal infected with <italic toggle="yes">Plasmodium</italic>. One week later, the
mosquitos were assayed for the number of oocysts in the midgut, the
next developmental stage after the ookinete that depends upon the
insect host. The results showed that therapeutic strains of the <italic toggle="yes">Pantoea</italic> symbiote <?A3B2 tlsb=-0.1pt?>were successful in suppressing the transition
to oocyst. Two of the strains displayed an impressive inhibition of
over 97%. The same strains also showed therapeutic inhibition in a
mouse model for malaria, <italic toggle="yes">P. berghei</italic>. Importantly,
the authors showed that mosquito lifespan is not affected by having
a genetically engineered symbiote instead of the wild type. They also
discuss a hopeful future where this technique, known as paratransgenesis,
could be implemented in the field so that mosquito soldiers can help
fight the spread of this deadly parasite.</p>

         <title>The Octopus Inks a New Script</title>
         <p>In many eukaryotes,
RNA editing machinery expands mRNA diversity by catalyzing selected
base changes in a post-transcriptional fashion. One type, adenosine
to inosine, or <?A3B2 show [?tjl=1000mm?]&#6;[?tjl]?>A-to-I, editing occurs by a deamination event of the
base. In turn, the translational machinery recognizes the inosine
base as if it was a guanosine, often resulting in a change in the
encoded <?A3B2 tlsb=-.02w?>amino acid. The enzymes carrying out this recoding event in
animals are known as ADARs, or Adenosine Deaminases Acting on RNAs.
ADARs play an important role in the nervous system of worms, fruit
flies and mammals, where editing events are critical for generating
diversity in transcripts involved in synaptic transmission and neural
plasticity. As such, ADAR mutants can have profound cognitive or behavioral
phenotypes. Now, this fascinating phenomenon meets <?A3B2 tlsb=-.01w?>an unexpected new
variable, environmental temperature, in a nervous system deep in the
ocean. <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22223739">Garrett and Rosenthal</ext-link> (<italic toggle="yes">Science</italic>, 2012, <italic toggle="yes">335</italic>, 848–851) demonstrate that A-to-I editing plays
an important role in tuning the potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) channel
excitation properties of both an Antarctic and tropical octopus species.</p>
         <p>After sequencing the channel-encoding genomic regions of the <?A3B2 tlsb=-0.15pt?>two
octopi and comparing to cloned mRNA transcripts, they discovered that
delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channel mRNAs are extensively edited
with some of the dozen edits displaying strong bias toward one thermal
environment dweller or the other. One mutation, I321V, was highly
edited in the cold water Antarctic octopus and electrophysiology experiments
demonstrated that this mutation has a strong effect in increasing
the rate of channel closure. This allows the channel to abbreviate
the refractory period between channel firings and probably helps to
compensate for the handicap of cold temperature. With this curious
finding in hand, the authors went on to sample the K<sup>+</sup> channel
editing of 6 more octopi living in water temperatures spanning from
−2 to +37 °C. They uncovered a very strong correlation
between the water temperature and the I321V <?A3B2 tlsb=-0.2pt?>editing event. As the
water temperature dropped, the extent of RNA editing increased. Since
ADARs usually act on structured RNA, one new direction will be to
study how temperature affects the folding of the mRNAs near the editing
site.</p>

known as DAPI, was identified and used as for a virtual screen to
identify additional compounds with improved binding properties. The
most potent compound discovered, 4-guanidinophenyl 4-guanidinobenzoate,
improved splicing defects in cellular models of Huntington’s
disease as well as in cells derived directly from a patient with Huntington’s
disease.</p>

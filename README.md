elements
========

In this repo, we are collecting examples of XML markup from participating publishers, as well as minimal examples. The purpose of the collection is to identify best practices.

-----

[XML JATS 
*elements*](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/tag-library/1.1d3/element/pub-elem-sec-intro.html) are logical [document 
components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Information_Set) that are referred to by 
their tag names. 

This repo contains XML examples collected from different publishers as well as minimal 
examples for using thematically related groups of JATS elements (e.g. for permissions, 
maths, or figures) and serves to elaborate best practices around using these elements.

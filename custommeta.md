Custom metadata use

## eLife

These are the current uses of the custom-meta tag we use in final published content. It is used during the production process to transmit information from editoral to production, but those are processing instructions so are stripped before publication so not included here.

```xml
<custom-meta-group>
                <custom-meta>
                    <meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name>
                    <meta-value>2.3</meta-value>
                </custom-meta>
                <custom-meta specific-use="meta-only">
                    <meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name>
                    <meta-value>The chemical nature of RIF-1 may reveal a new class of bacterial signaling molecules.</meta-value>
                </custom-meta>
            </custom-meta-group>
```

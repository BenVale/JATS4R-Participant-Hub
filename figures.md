    <title>Efsevin restores rhythmic cardiac contractions in zebrafish tremblor 
      embryos.</title>
    <p>(<bold>A</bold>) Line scans across the atria of <italic>Tg(myl7:GFP)</italic> 
      embryonic hearts at 48 hpf. Rhythmically alternating systoles and diastoles are 
      recorded from vehicle- (upper left) or efsevin- treated wild type (upper right) and 
      efsevin-treated <italic>tre</italic> (lower right) embryos, while only sporadic 
      unsynchronized contractions are recorded from vehicle-treated <italic>tre</italic> 
      embryos (lower left). (<bold>B</bold>, <bold>C</bold>) Fractional shortening (FS) 
      deduced from the line-scan traces. While cardiac contraction was not observed in 
      <italic>tre</italic>, efsevin-treated wild type and <italic>tre</italic> hearts have 
      similar levels of FS to those observed in control hearts. Ventricular FS of wild 
      type v.s. wild type &#x2b; efsevin vs tre &#x2b; efsevin: 39 &#xb1; 0.6%, n &#x3d; 8 vs 
      39 &#xb1; 1%, n &#x3d; 10 vs 35 &#xb1; 3%, n &#x3d; 6; and Atrial FS: 37 &#xb1; 1%, n 
      &#x3d; 11 vs 35 &#xb1; 2%, n &#x3d; 11 vs 33 &#xb1; 2%, n &#x3d; 15. (<bold>D</bold>) 
      While efsevin restored a heart rate of 46 &#xb1; 2 beats per minute (bpm) in 
      <italic>tre</italic> embryos, same treatment does not affect the heart rate in wild 
      type embryos (126 &#xb1; 2 bpm in vehicle-treated embryos vs 123 &#xb1; 3 bpm in 
      efsevin-treated wild-type embryos). &#x2a;&#x2a;&#x2a;, p &#x3c; 0.001 by one-way ANOVA.
      (<bold>E</bold>) Dose-dependence curve for efsevin. The <italic>tre</italic> embryos 
      were treated with various concentrations of efsevin from 24 hpf and cardiac 
      contractions were analyzed at 48 hpf. (<bold>F</bold>&#x2013;<bold>H</bold>) 
      Representative time traces of local field potentials for wild type (<bold>F</bold>),

        success was measured as percentage of females that successfully brought a litter to

        that exhibited lordosis and allowed a male to achieve intromission within 15 min 
        (g-statistics: G &#x3d; 2.405, df &#x3d; 1 p &#x3d; 0.028, fisher's exact test p

        identified in the dam's uterine horns after birth. (<bold>H</bold>) Embryo survival 
        was calculated as the number of birthed pups divided by number of maternal placental 
        scars and shown as a percentage (indicative of initial implantation, mean &#xb1; 
        SEM) &#x2a;p &#x3c; 0.05, &#x2a;&#x2a;p &#x3c; 0.01, &#x2a;&#x2a;&#x2a;p &#x3c;

        Fisher's Exact test, statistics for litter size, placental scars, and embryo 
        resorption were done by a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni 
        post-hoc testsb and CORT statistics analyzed by a repeated two-way ANOVA.</p>

      <title>RFRP-shRNA animals had increased plasma estradiol on proestrus during stress 
        and RFRP-shRNA animals that mated had higher circulating estradiol than scrambled 
        animals.</title>
      <p>(<bold>A</bold>) Estradiol levels as measured from tail bleed samples 
        over the cycles of all stressed rats with either scrambled or RFRP-shRNA virus (n 
        &#x3d; 14). (<bold>B</bold>) Within proestrus, estradiol measurements were separated 
        by mating success and virus (n &#x3d; 10, 21, 11, 25 samples for each successive 
        group). (<bold>C</bold>) Lordosis intensity, or quality of the lordosis pose, scored 
        between 0 and 3 as published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hardy and Debold 
          (1971)</xref>. We found a significant main effect of stress (F(1, 61) &#x3d; 
        5.15, p &#x3d; 0.0268), however, no significant differences within groups. 
        (<bold>D</bold>) Lordosis quotient was calculated as the ratio of male mounts to 
        female lordosis poses of a score of 2 or 3. We found a significant main effect of 
        stress (F(1, 61) &#x3d; 11.66, p &#x3d; 0.0011), as well a significant decrease in 
        the scramble stress group. p &#x3c; 0.05, &#x2a;&#x2a;p &#x3c; 0.01, 
        &#x2a;&#x2a;&#x2a;p &#x3c; 0.001. Estradiol, lordosis intensity and quotient 
        statistics were a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni 
        post-hoc tests.</p>
